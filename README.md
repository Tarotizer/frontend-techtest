# Frontend Tech Test

This is a simple test to evaluate basic front-end development skills.

Please treat this task like you would any other task at work - feel free to search the web, and try to write code which is easily maintained by others.

The simple webpage in this test is served using an application called Shunter.

Steps
-----
1. Visit the [Shunter Repository](https://github.com/springernature/shunter) and read the documentation
2. Fork this repo
3. Part of the Shunter setup has been completed for you. Finish setting up the application
4. Download and run the [backend application](https://github.com/springernature/frontend-techtest-backend) (no work should be needed in this repository)
5. Make any changes necessary for the front end to talk to the backend
6. Amend the template so that data is being used from the backend application
7. Remove the duplication of the link text in the title attribute
8. Replace this with a tooltip that appears when you hover over the link
9. Submit a pull request with your changes

Acceptance criteria
-------------------
1. When hovering over the links, a tooltip should appear
2. Images should appear inline with the links
3. There must be no duplication of content
4. There must be no title attribute used - at all
5. The solution must not interfere with standard browser behaviour
6. HTML and CSS must validate
7. The principles of Progressive Enhancement must not be violated
8. Browser support: YUI GBS
9. Must be easy to maintain
